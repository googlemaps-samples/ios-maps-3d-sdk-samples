# Google Maps Platform Maps 3D SDK for iOS Samples

## Description

This is the sample app for the Google Maps iOS 3D Maps SDK. 

It demonstrates various features of the SDK: displaying a map, controlling the camera,
adding markers, shapes and models, handling click events on Place markers, and animating views.

## Requirements

* XCode 15 or later.
* A physical iOS device for running the app if possible. 
At this first Experimental release stage, the iOS Simulator may not perform well, but can be used.

2. Enable the Maps 3D SDK for iOS on your project.
3. Create an API key.
4. Clone this repository.
5. Open the project in Xcode. 
6. Add your API key to the project. Use an .xcconfig file or edit Info.plist to specify a value for MAPS_API_KEY
7. Build and run the app.

## Usage
